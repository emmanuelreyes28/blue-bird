## Blue Bird

A mininum viable product (mvp) clone of X, formerly known as Twitter. Users can easily sign-in with their GitHub or LinkedIn account. Once signed-in, users can post tweets and like other users' posts.

## How It Was Built

I used React/Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL and Supabase.

## What I Learned

- TypeScript
- Cookie-based Auth
- Authorization with Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Fetching and Mutating Data
- Realtime subscriptions
- Postgres Trigger Functions

## How Can I Make It Better?

- Add retweet and comment features
- Account page where users can edit their profile information
- Ability to follow other users for a more tailored timeline
